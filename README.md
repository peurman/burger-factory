# Week 5 Part 1

## BURGER FACTORY

We had to create a simple burger builder, with at least 3 ingredients: <br/>
• Meat ($1.50)<br/>
• Cheese ($0.50)<br/>
• Salad ($0.25)<br/>
Our users can build a burger using any mix of ingredients they like.<br/>
When a user adds or removes an ingredient you need to update the burger's ingredients visually, also the buttons and total detail.<br/>
A thing to consider: The burger has a base Price of $1.00. <br/>
The state of the burger must be saved in local storage.<br/>

### Additional Information

• Don't use Any to define object types.<br/>
• Use any directive you considered useful.<br/>
Don't use CSS framework like bootstrap.<br/>
• Create at least 3 components to build this app.<br/>
• The burger, price and buttons need to be updated when a new ingredient is added or removed. · The price should be formatted with 2 decimals and the $ currency symbol. <br/>
• You can change the currency type (ej: USD, AUD, MXN). The default currency to be shown is USD. · Use local storage to persist data.<br/>
• Your solution need to easily allow more ingredients to be available. You can add more ingredients if you want to.<br/>

### Extra Credits

• Make a great looking UI. Draw the burger and ingredients with CSS instead of using images and use CSS Animations.<br/>
• Save burger and show history of previous created burger. When you click a burger from the history it will update the current burger.<br/>

### I hope you enjoy it!
